## Why to use

* The introduction of reactivity system makes codes more expressive and saves plenty of state synchronization codes, so the state management is easier.
* In-depth support for TypeScript is added to the original Alipay mini program, improving greatly the development experience and productivity.
* Like the [Vue Composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/), brand-new method is used for the organization of state logic codes. Compare to the traditional Redux-like state manage system, the boilerplate codes are near to nothing, and it is more friendly to TypeScript.
